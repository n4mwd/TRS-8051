
Version 1.01

Changes: 
1. Instr() now ignores case.
2. Changed logical TRUE to -1 instead of 1.
3. Changed NOT, AND and OR from logical operators to bitwise.  The manual says they are logical, but they are 
   actually bitwise operators. 
4. Added command LINE INPUT.
5. Added DEFtypes commands DEFDBL, DEFINT, DEFSNG, DEFSTR.  Note doubles are supported and singles.
6. Corrected the operation of INT() function.
7. Added functions CINT() and FIX()
8. Added function EXTKEY which returns flags showing current status of control keys.  The bit fields are:
   [MSB] R-WIN L-WIN R-ALT L-ALT R-CTRL L-CTRL R-SHIFT L-SHIFT [LSB]
9. Created TRS-8051-Syntax.TXT which defines the set of syntax rules used by the interpreter.
10. Added TIMER function which returns the number of milliseconds since the program started.
11. Added TIME$ function which returns a string with time and date.  Due to hardware restrictions, the date 
    doesn't really work and time time is the time since the program started.  This is not in the Level 2
    documentation but works in the actual program.

Todo:
1. Add block IF statements.  These will be identified by using BEGIN instead of THEN in IF statements. ELSE can be
   on a separate line.  Block terminates with the ENDIF command.  Nested IF-BLOCKs allowed.
2. Fix bug where ELSE is immediately preceeded by a digit, the tokenizer interprets it as an exponentiated float 
   followed by a variable named 'LSE'.
3. Get package compilable in Keil C51.
4. Change tokenizing syntax rules to require a space after a keyword.  This eliminates keyword-variable collision 
   problems.
5. Change EDIT command to operate as a full screen editor rather than a line editor.
6. Change LIST command to prompt user "<Press space for more, ESC to stop>".
7. Support '&H' style hex constants.
